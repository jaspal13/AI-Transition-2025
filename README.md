# 📘 AI-Transition

A personal learning and project repository documenting my transition into **AI / LLM-based systems**, with a strong focus on **hands-on coding**, **practical experiments**, and **real-world patterns**.

This repo is not a single polished project — it’s a **learning journey** showing progression from Python fundamentals to advanced topics like **RAG systems**, **LLM pipelines**, and **AI-driven applications**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Refresh and strengthen **Python** for AI work
- Build intuition around **LLMs, RAG, and GenAI systems**
- Create a **visible portfolio** of learning-by-doing
- Avoid tutorial hell by shipping small, concrete experiments

This repository reflects *how I actually learn and build*, not just final results.

## 🧭 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into **phases / modules**, each focusing on a specific area:

| Folder | Focus |
|------|------|
| `01-python` | Python fundamentals & refresh (from a Java background) |
| `02-openai-experiments` | Experiments with OpenAI / LLM APIs |
| `03-rag` | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems |
| `04-llm-from-scratch` | Understanding LLM workflows and internals |
| _(future)_ | AI microservices, integrations, and end-to-end apps |

> Each folder is self-contained and may include notebooks, scripts, and notes.
